# Sudoku-solver

This project is a Sudoku solver.

The program opens the unsolved Sudoku problem from an input file. Currently the code is hard-coded to open the 'AI Escargot' Sudoku problem which is purported to be the 
most difficult Sudoku problem ever produced, chosen to be a good demonstration that the code can solver any Suduku problem within a reasonable time period.
